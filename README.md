Single Arm Clock in HTML 5

##Description
The [Continue Time clock](http://www.sandermulder.com/continue_time.html) is an modern, one-of-a-kind, physical wall clock by artist Sander Muller.

This experiment tries to emulate the functionality of this peculiar clock. I decided to use the KineticJS framework, since it handles a lot of the manual work to working with Canvas objects.

##Usage:
Clone and run index.html
